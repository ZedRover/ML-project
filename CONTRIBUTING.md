# Contributing to SJTUBeamermin

SJTUBeamermin is now at 0.9-beta-LTS. Since it is final exam week in SJTU, the author himself won't have more time on this template until July 1st. And it is a good time for you to show your talent on TeXing! ðŸ¥°

Long Term Support (LTS) hallmark means there will be no significant change on the template in a period. Furthermore, **No Issues before July 1st will be Closed.** Noticing that there could be no more contributors to answer your questions, the author writes a developer's guide on this template.

**[DEVELOPER'S GUIDE ON SJTUBEAMERMIN](doc/SJTUBeamermindevguide.pdf)**

This guide will tell you how the template is composed. If you have some problems with the internal mechanism, refer to this guide and perform debugging actions. When getting familiar with this whole project, you could modify some definitions of the components or create your features by **forking this repo**. After implementing your great TeX code, **Pull Request** your repo back to this upstream and benefit more users. Reasonable contributions will get merged into the next version of SJTUBeamermin.
